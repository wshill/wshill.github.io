Clicking on the book title opens up the full page for the book and includes an excerpt from the book as well as format specific buy links for the title. Most of the content layout is HTML while the portions that remain constant from page to page are blocks or theme built-ins. The theme was designed using Artisteer and has been updated and upgraded numerous times as required by the needs of the site. While Drupal is a durable and robust CMS, it's not necessarily the most user friendly I've seen. That said, Drupal 8 is showing much promise and is making strides toward addressing some of the user issues and shortening the deployment cycle for fixes and upgrades. A back burner project is to transition the site over to Drupal 8, which is not a trivial undertaking at present.</p>
