                    links for the title. Most of the content layout is HTML while the portions that remain constant from page to page are blocks or theme built-ins. The theme was designed using Artisteer and has been updated and upgraded numerous times
                    as required by the needs of the site. While Drupal is a durable and robust CMS, it's not necessarily the most user friendly I've seen. That said, Drupal 8 is showing much promise and is making strides toward addressing some of the
                    user issues and shortening the deployment cycle for fixes and upgrades. A back burner project is to transition the site over to Drupal 8, which is not a trivial undertaking at present.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I started building web sites as a hobby with FrontPage. I've long since graduated to using CMS's e.g. WordPress, Drupal, Concrete5, Social Engine, and a few others. I've never really found that one CMS that gave me the flexibility and
                    features I wanted right out of the box. Instead of "making do", I found ways to incorporate modules, javascript, bits of code, etc. to get closer to what I was trying to achieve, but I've never been 100% satisfied with the result.
                    Following a change in my career path, I have more time to dedicate to web design, so I finally decided the best approach would be to learn the tools used to customize, extend, and build the CMS packages I had been using to give me
                    ultimate flexibility and control. So here I am. You've seen what I have done. I'm looking forward to seeing what I'll do next. Interested? Shoot me an e-mail and I'll let you know where I'm headed, or maybe you have an idea to suggest!</p>
